How does docker and docker compose work ? 

    - docker is a tools that allows us to run applications in isolated environments called containers.
    - docker-compose is a toold that allows us to define and manage multi-container application.

why use docker-compose ?

    - Use one file to automatically run multiple containerd instead of having to run each one manually.

benefit of Docker vs VM's ? 
    - lightweight because they work on the host OS unlike VM's which have separate OS.
    - portability, can run on all environments unlike VM's which depend on hypervisors and OS compatibility
    - Startup speed, Containers start in seconds while VM'S take minutes.
